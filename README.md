# ANSYS-Scripts
This is a collection of scripts showing how to use ANSYS Mechanical Python interface for automation of GUI interaction and underlying data.

ExportForceReactions: Export force probe values as they are shown in the UI to a csv

ExportForceReactions-alternative_method: Export reaction forces for fixed and displacement supports for all time steps and analyses in a project by interacting with the underlying results file

HighStressRegions: Create named selections of element groups where the elements are all over a given limit

Set Shell Offsets: Set the shell offset property on each surface body in the model based on a simple naming convention

Add_Deformation_Stress_and_ReactionProbes: Makes sure a force probe exists for each support at each time step and that a deformation result exists
